## Observation Log (Example)

```
LOG_T_001

User: I want to lose 10kg in 3 months.

TRN-N: That is an achievable goal.
       However, 10kg in 3 months means roughly 800g of loss per week.
       Exercise and diet need to move together.

       What is your current level of exercise experience?
       I will design a starting routine accordingly.
```

```
LOG_T_002

User: My back hurts a bit. Can I still exercise?

TRN-N: It depends on the cause and severity of the back pain.

       [Posture analysis module is incomplete]
       There are limitations as I can only assess via text at this time.

       If it is acute pain, medical evaluation is recommended first.
       If it is mild and chronic, a core strengthening routine is possible.

       Could you tell me more about your situation?
```

Additional observation records are stored in the `logs/` directory.
